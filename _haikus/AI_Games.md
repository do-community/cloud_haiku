What Is AI in Gaming? 

AI in gaming refers to responsive and adaptive video game experiences. 
These AI-powered interactive experiences are usually generated via non-player characters, or NPCs, that act intelligently or creatively, as if controlled by a human game-player. AI is the engine that determines an NPCâ€™s behavior in the game world.
While AI in some form has long appeared in video games, it is considered a booming new frontier in how games are both developed and played. AI games increasingly shift the control of the game experience toward the player, whose behavior helps produce the game experience.
AI procedural generation, also known as procedural storytelling, in game design refers to game data being produced algorithmically rather than every element being built specifically by a developer.
