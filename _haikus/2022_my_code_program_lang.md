No code runs faster than no code.<br>
No code has fewer bugs than no code.<br>
No code uses less memory than no code.<br>
No code is easier to understand than no code.<br>

All of the above - Has it been that long since I laughed at my computer? ! lmao<br>
Three things are certain:<br>
Death, taxes and lost data.<br>
Guess which has occurred. - defo 1st level engineering<br>

Serious error.<br>
All shortcuts have disappeared.<br>
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.<br>

python: less is more<br>
ruby: devs should be happy<br>
