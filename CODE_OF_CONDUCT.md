# DigitalOcean Community Code of Conduct

DigitalOcean is committed to ensuring that Community remains a welcoming destination for people from all walks of life to learn, share knowledge, and connect with one another. In order to maintain this environment, it is our expectation that Community members uphold the following code of conduct.

## Be kind

### Be generous with ideas and kind to others

While here, you may encounter ideas, viewpoints, and technologies that are unfamiliar to you. You may even find some that you disagree with. The DigitalOcean Community welcomes multiple approaches to solve the same problem. As a platform for communal learning, please lead with generosity when interacting with others and avoid derailing the conversation and detracting from the educational value of content for others. We encourage members of the DigitalOcean Community to keep an open mind, and to commit to being thoughtful when sharing knowledge.

## No spam

### Keep spam in the can

Content posted to Community must be on-topic and constructive. Promotional content, content designed to create backlinks, trolling, links to harmful websites, or content unrelated to the topic at hand may be removed.

## No abuse

### No tolerance for abuse

Our goal is for everyone in our Community to feel welcome, which is why we encourage members to contribute in a way that is inclusive, supports learning, and promotes the welfare of others. To that end, malicious behavior, harassment, and offensive language that is in reference to (but not limited to) age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, neurodiversity, personal appearance, race, religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or technology choices will not be tolerated.

## Be honest

## Donâ€™t intentionally mislead

The DigitalOcean Community is first and foremost a place for learning. Community members who purposely misinform others or who give advice in bad faith run the risk of their account being terminated.

DigitalOcean reserves the right to remove content that fails to meet the standards set forth in this code of conduct. Likewise, DigitalOcean reserves the right to prohibit individual users from participating in Community at its sole discretion. This policy applies to tutorials, comments, questions, answers, and reviews published on DigitalOcean Community.
